# Apps for Mobile Devices

Hello everyone! This repository has been made as a way to store and share my projects from this subject between my devices.
The contents that you could find in this repository are mostly coming from Android Studio.

All these projects have been made using Android Studio Iguana (They must work in this and upper versions).
